    <p>Bring to the table win-win survival strategies to ensure proactive domination. At the end of the day, 
        going forward, a new normal that has evolved from generation X is on the runway heading towards a 
        streamlined cloud solution. User generated content in real-time will have multiple touchpoints for 
        offshoring.
